Dawn is best, when sight joins sound. First, the whisper of waves shows a glimmer, a sheen, becoming a whiteness that edges the sand; then the rocks sigh and gently free their forms from the surrounding dark; the air starts to quiver and murmur with light; and the blur of a bird sounds a single envious trill.

     We are there, we are ready. We greet the day and the dawn, feeling the hushed heartbeat of the world gathering strength for the effort to come. And then we sing. Perhaps one of us will find a fragment of refrain, some old golden song belonging to legend that has always existed and only needs finding again, and we take it, caress it, give it wings and send it phoenix-like away.

     Evening has its time too though. Then, mellowness deepens to dusk; the waves whisper of rest; stars gently chime; the moon has a deeper note. Sound becomes scent, spicy thyme yielding to fragrance of fern, sun-warmed rocks to coolness of earth. And our song, our celebration, changes in tone.

     It must be the celebration, the feeling of joy that maddens them. When they hear it, they feel excluded, futile, their heroics reduced to posturing, their words exposed as senseless noise, and ... they try to reach it. They beat their way through the waves, while we watch and sing and will not help; we suspect it is not joy but our particular joy they want to reach and conquer. Perhaps they want what we found long ago.

     Of course they fail, and of course the stories start, and the fear and the hatred and the hard words, so that truth is made mute in a babble of lies. Sometimes we sing of that as well, but never willingly, never with pleasure, even though we know the song must include all things. No joy can exist without sorrow, and no song without silence either.

     There was one man who heard and understood – now so far in the past we wonder if we dreamed him. The ship passed, sleek and swift in the water, the sailors bent double over their oars as though in agony, their faces ugly with fear and loathing. We knew they could not hear us: they laboured and strained and did not even look, did not try and dash their lives away.

Galdiator
Just a mile outside the city limits of Council, Oklahoma, a man in dirty jeans and a soiled gray sweatshirt stood above Interstate 40 on the Route 81 overpass. It was an early November morning, the sun just becoming visible in the East, and he rubbed his hands together in an attempt to alleviate the chill in his bones. Eighteen wheelers were starting to fly by in both directions. Trucks headed east went on into Oklahoma City, from there who knows. They could meet up with I-35 and travel south to Dallas or Houston. North to Kansas City, Omaha or maybe all the way to the Twin Cities. Possibly keep driving east over to Memphis or Nashville. Might take I-44 and go straight on to St. Louis. Be there by mid-afternoon.

     He decided he'd follow the westbound road. There just seemed to be fewer options that way. Trucks heading west had to go all the way to Amarillo for a decent stop. He'd gone that far west with his family once. It was years before at the age of thirteen when an uncle was married in Dumas, Texas. That had been nice. He remembered how when they reached Amarillo they went north up into the panhandle. Even though there weren't any mountains, he could still feel them climbing into higher altitude, but when they rolled into Dumas it was just as flat as western Oklahoma. "High plains," his father said from the front seat. He hadn't thought of there being a higher kind of flat.

     Walking with his head down along the interstate, his heartbeat rose whenever he caught sight of a plastic bottle, only to be let down when it didn't contain urine. He knew truck drivers used meth to stay awake on cross country drives. Knew that many of them would rather piss in a bottle and throw it out the window than lose fifteen minutes with a truck stop. Recycled meth wasn't as pure a dose, but a batch of good urine still got him five hours once.

     He found himself picking at the scab on his left hand as he continued walking. A nervous tic that had gotten out of control. He shoved his hands into his pockets, but kept thinking about the sores on his body, causing him to bring a hand up to his face and run it over the rough patches on his forehead. He wondered what he looked like. Probably homeless, and at that point, he supposed he kind of was. His girlfriend left the week before, less than a day after they shut off the electricity. Shut the water off a few days after that.

She had gone to stay with her folks in Hobart, which had its conditions. One, that she couldn't see him anymore – her parents never had liked the fact she was eight years younger than him. And two, that her father the cop would administer a drug test every two weeks. She was a fool. So were her parents. He knew it would end badly.

     With his headache becoming more acute, he contemplated crossing the interstate to search the other side. He thought about the dynamics of driving – how the driver was on the left side. Would they really lean across the passenger seat to toss out a bottle of piss? The stretch of grass separating eastbound and westbound was more likely.

     He was wondering if a highway patrolman would stop him for walking in the median when he caught sight of a plastic bottle lying in the grass. The unmistakable golden color was nearly concealed by the lifeless grass surrounding it. He slid down to his knees and picked up the bottle. It wasn't warm. He wondered if that mattered. With thoughts of separation and reconstitution he shook the bottle up like juice. He twisted the cap off and brought the bottle to his nose, wishing there was some way to know if it contained meth. He didn't think there was.

Fishing for jasmine
The silent young woman in bed number six is called Jasmine. So am I, but names are only superficial things, floats bobbing on the surface of the water, and we share deeper connections than that. Which is why she fascinates me - why I spend my off-duty time sitting beside her.

     Today is difficult. The ward heaves with patients and I am kept busy emptying bed-pans, filling out forms, changing dressings. Finally, late in the afternoon, I get a few moments to make coffee, to take it over to the orange plastic chair beside her bed. I am thankful to be off my feet, glad to be in her company once again.

     "Hello, Jasmine," I say, as if greeting myself.

     She does not reply. Jasmine never replies. She is down too deep.

     Like me, she has been sea-damaged. I too am the daughter of a fisherman, so I bait my words like fish-hooks, cast them into her ears, imagine them sinking down through cold, dark water. Down to wherever she may be.

     "I have little time today," I tell her, touching her hair.

     With Jasmine, it is always difficult not to touch. She is that rare thing, a truly beautiful woman. Because of this, people invent reasons to walk by. I catch them looking, drinking her in, feeding on her. They are barracuda, all of them. Wheelchair-pushing porters who slow to a crawl when they near her bed. Roaming visitors with greedy eyes. Doctors who stop, draw the thin screen of curtain, and continually re-examine that which does not need examination.

     Great beauty is something Jasmine and I do not share. I am glad of it.

     "Your father may be here soon," I say. "Last week he said he would come."

     Jasmine says nothing. Her left eyelid flickers, perhaps.

     It is two months since the incident on her father's fishing boat, since she fell overboard, sank, became entangled in the nets. It was some time before anyone noticed, then there was panic. Her father hauled her back on board and sailed for home. When he finally arrived, he carried ashore what he thought was his daughter's body.
 "Jasmine," I whisper. I want her to take our baited name. I want her to swallow it.

     Fortunately, there was a doctor in the village that morning, a young man visiting relatives. It was he who brought this drowned woman back from the brink, he who told me her story. She opened her eyes, he said, looked up at her father and spoke a single word - then sank again, this time into coma.

     Barracuda. That is what Jasmine said.

     When her father visits, he touches her hair, kisses her cheek, sits in the orange plastic chair at the side of her bed and holds her hand. Like my own father, he has the big, brown, life-roughened hands of a fisherman. He too smells of the sea, and pretends he is a good, simple man.

     Jasmine. We share so much, we are almost one.

     I remember early mornings, my hair touched to wake me, my father lifting me half-asleep from my bed, carrying me, dropping me into his boat. His voice rough in my ear, his hands rough on my skin. I never wanted to go, but I was just a child. He did as he wished.

     I remember salt water, hot sun, my mother shrinking on the shore. I remember the rocking of the boat, the screams of the gulls.

     "Jasmine, you have a life inside you. Can't you hear it calling?"

     Nothing.

     The ward door bangs, and I see Jasmine's father walking towards us, carrying flowers. He smiles at me. Even in death, my own child had my father's smile, and Jasmine's will have this man's. I know it.

     He stops by her bed and touches her hair. Something stirs deep inside me. I watch Jasmine's eyelids, waiting for her to bite.

     Fisherman
     The sun was barely above the horizon when the fisherman untied his boat and set himself free of dry land. Each wave he crossed, heading out to sea, marked a greater distance between him and everything to do with him. With every crest, he was a little further away from is house. His house, no longer his home. Yes, it had walls and furniture and pictures, but it had no spirit. The photos, the tables and the chairs existed without reason, without source; like the faded perfume of his wife which still lingered in the air long after she had gone.

The old spluttering engine took him ten miles away from the port, and as he shut it off the land from which he’d come was hardly visible. Now he only felt at home on the sea. The sea’s smell carried his memories, its openness formed his walls, his pictures were made from the light which danced over the waves.

He cast his two lines off either side and sat back. The sea was calm and the early morning sun, still only low in the sky, meandered towards him over the mottled water. The sea was where he could think. Not that he was a thinking man, the fisherman, not in a philosophical or critical way. Really he was a rememberer. The fisherman never thought to the future, never worried financially or planned carefully. He thought back. He remembered.

And on the sea, free from conditions of time and place, his memories could fill his whole vision. Without another person around he had a whole world to himself.

Him, his lines, and his memories.

Ready for meals

Malcolm sat in his kitchen, looking at his mobile phone lying on the table next to the remnants of a ready meal. The little shiny box stared back at him, a big square eye dressed in a sleek stainless steel cloak. The eye was dark, motionless. No one had called. No message had arrived. Malcolm checked his watch: it was 9:30pm. He’d been ready for an hour, waiting for contact. He’d put on his new white shirt and smart black trousers, he’d shaved, he’d put on some of the aftershave his ex had given him for Christmas. Malcolm was ready for a night out. It had been basically arranged earlier, he remembered. When they’d all left work, Malcolm had said he’d go home and get changed, have some food, and Tony had said that one of them would call around 8pm. Malcolm wondered why they hadn’t called. And then it came to him. They’d thought of calling, all three of his mates from work, they’d picked up their phones to call each other and him and work out where to go, and they’d been just about to speed dial Malcolm first when each one of them thought, ‘wait a minute, I don’t need to call Malcolm, because surely someone else will already have done it’. Each of his friends had mistakenly thought, given Malcolm’s popularity and importance, that the others would call him. Malcolm knew he was right, that’s why he now sat waiting for someone to call. Well, he could call them he thought, but then realised that if he did he would look awfully needy. It wasn’t as if Malcolm didn’t have other people to go out with - a lot of other people he could go out with – so Malcolm decided to wait. Then when they called to ask him to come out – he could see it now, them calling and being so sorry, feeling so bad that they hadn’t called, having such a bad time without him – he’d say something like: ‘maybe I’ll come, it sounds like it might be alright’ or ‘yeah, but give me sometime to get ready’ or maybe even ‘not tonight lads, I fancy staying in, with the girlfriend, you know’.
